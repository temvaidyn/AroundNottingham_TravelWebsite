			<h2>Notts County
      </h2>
				<p> The oldest professional association football club playing at a professional level, Notts County, can be found playing in their traditional black and white stripes on Saturday afternoons. Their current team contains former Premier League champion Alan Smith, who made his mark playing for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson.
        <br>
        The club used to play their matches inside the old Nottingham Castle, but nowadays, you can watch ‘The Magpies’ from the terraces of Meadow Lane, not too far from the city centre.</p>

			<h2> Nottingham Ice Centre
      </h2>
				<p> The first twin Olympic-sized ice rink in the UK, found in the heart of Nottingham, was officially opened by Olympic Gold Medalist Jane Torvill, in 2000. You may not be as graceful as Torvill at ice skating, but there are lots of opportunities to have fun and develop your skills on the ice all year round.
        <br>
        If you’d rather wrap up warm and watch from the stands, you can see Nottingham Panthers Ice Hockey Team in action. The Panthers are one of Britain’s most successful professional ice hockey sides and often get more than 5,000 spectators for their home games!</p>
