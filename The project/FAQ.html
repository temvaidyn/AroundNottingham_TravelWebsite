			<h2> What is Nottingham? </h2>
				<p>Nottingham has a unique place in British history and folklore, being the old home and hunting grounds of none other than Robin Hood. Even besides that remarkable claim to fame, it’s a city with an extraordinary past and future. It was once famous for its lace and remains an important place in the fashion world, being the birthplace of designer Sir Paul Smith.
				<br>
				There is more to this East Midlands town than old buildings and men in tights, though. The city centre is packed with shopping malls, sports stadiums, nightclubs and restaurants. It’s a lively place with interesting things to see and do around every corner and an award-winning public transport system to get you there.</p>
